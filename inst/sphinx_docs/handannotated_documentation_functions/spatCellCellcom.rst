******************
Value 
******************
A cell-Cell communication score for gene pairs based on expression only.


************************
Details
************************
Statistical framework to identify if pairs of genes (such as ligand-receptor combinations) are expressed at higher levels than expected based on a reshuffled null distribution of gene expression values in cells that are spatially in proximity to each other.

* LR_comb:Pair of ligand and receptor
* lig_cell_type: cell type to assess expression level of ligand
* lig_expr: average expression of ligand in lig_cell_type
* ligand: ligand name
* rec_cell_type: cell type to assess expression level of receptor
* rec_expr: average expression of receptor in rec_cell_type
* receptor: receptor name
* LR_expr: combined average ligand and receptor expression
* lig_nr: total number of cells from lig_cell_type that spatially interact with cells from rec_cell_type
* rec_nr: total number of cells from rec_cell_type that spatially interact with cells from lig_cell_type
* rand_expr: average combined ligand and receptor expression from random spatial permutations
* av_diff: average difference between LR_expr and rand_expr over all random spatial permutations
* sd_diff: (optional) standard deviation of the difference between LR_expr and rand_expr over all random spatial permutations
* z_score: (optinal) z-score
* log2fc: log2 fold-change (LR_expr/rand_expr)
* pvalue: p-value
* LR_cell_comb: cell type pair combination
* p.adj: adjusted p-value
* PI: significance score: log2fc * -log10(p.adj)
