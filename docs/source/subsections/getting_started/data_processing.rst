After creating the Giotto object, it must be prepared for downstream
analysis. This tutorial walks through filtering, normalizing, adjusting
for batch effects, adding statistics and metadata to a Giotto object, as
well as high efficiency options for data processing.

This tutorial uses a SeqFISH+ dataset of a murine cortex and
subventrical zone. A complete walkthrough of that dataset can be found
`here <../datasets/seqFISH_cortex.html>`__. To download the data used to
create the Giotto Object below, please ensure that
`wget <https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/?>`__ is installed locally.

This dataset contains multiple field of views; here, a workflow to bring
the FOVs together for holistic analysis is illustrated, and then a
subset of the Giotto Object is taken to analyze the cortex.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r
      
      # Ensure Giotto Suite is installed.
      if(!"Giotto" %in% installed.packages()) {
        devtools::install_github("drieslab/Giotto@Suite")
      }

      # Ensure GiottoData, a small, helper module for tutorials, is installed.
      if(!"GiottoData" %in% installed.packages()) {
        devtools::install_github("drieslab/GiottoData")
      }
      library(Giotto)
      # Ensure the Python environment for Giotto has been installed.
      genv_exists = checkGiottoEnvironment()
      if(!genv_exists){
        # The following command need only be run once to install the Giotto environment.
        installGiottoEnvironment()
      }

1 Create the Giotto Object
==========================

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      library(Giotto)
      library(GiottoData)

      # Specify path from which data may be retrieved/stored
      data_directory = paste0(getwd(),'/gobject_processing_data/')
      # alternatively, "/path/to/where/the/data/lives/"

      # Specify path to which results may be saved
      results_directory = paste0(getwd(),'/gobject_processing_results/') 
      # alternatively, "/path/to/store/the/results/"

      # Optional: Specify a path to a Python executable within a conda or miniconda 
      # environment. If set to NULL (default), the Python executable within the previously
      # installed Giotto environment will be used.
      my_python_path = NULL # alternatively, "/local/python/path/python" if desired.

      getSpatialDataset(dataset = 'seqfish_SS_cortex', directory = data_directory, method = 'wget')

      # Set Giotto instructions
      instrs = createGiottoInstructions(save_plot = TRUE, 
                                        show_plot = FALSE,
                                        save_dir = results_directory, 
                                        python_path = my_python_path)

      # Create Giotto object by providing paths
      expr_path = paste0(data_directory, "cortex_svz_expression.txt")
      loc_path = paste0(data_directory, "cortex_svz_centroids_coord.txt")
      meta_path = paste0(data_directory, "cortex_svz_centroids_annot.txt")


      # This dataset contains multiple field of views which need to be stitched together.

      # First, merge location and additional metadata
      SS_locations = data.table::fread(loc_path)
      cortex_fields = data.table::fread(meta_path)
      SS_loc_annot = data.table::merge.data.table(SS_locations, cortex_fields, by = 'ID')
      SS_loc_annot[, ID := factor(ID, levels = paste0('cell_',1:913))]
      data.table::setorder(SS_loc_annot, ID)

      # Create a file with offset information
      my_offset_file = data.table::data.table(field = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                                              x_offset = c(0, 1654.97, 1750.75, 1674.35, 675.5, 2048, 675),
                                              y_offset = c(0, 0, 0, 0, -1438.02, -1438.02, 0))

      # Create a file to stitch the multiple fields of view together
      stitch_file = stitchFieldCoordinates(location_file = SS_loc_annot,
                                           offset_file = my_offset_file,
                                           cumulate_offset_x = T,
                                           cumulate_offset_y = F,
                                           field_col = 'FOV',
                                           reverse_final_x = F,
                                           reverse_final_y = T)

      stitch_file    = stitch_file[,.(ID, X_final, Y_final)]
      stitch_file$ID = as.character(stitch_file$ID) # ID must be a character vector
      my_offset_file = my_offset_file[,.(field, x_offset_final, y_offset_final)]

      # Create Giotto object
      testobj <- createGiottoObject(expression = expr_path,
                                    spatial_locs = stitch_file,
                                    offset_file = my_offset_file,
                                    instructions = instrs)

      # Add additional annotation if wanted
      testobj = addCellMetadata(testobj,
                                new_metadata = cortex_fields,
                                by_column = T,
                                column_cell_ID = 'ID')

      # Subset data to the cortex field of views in a new Giotto object
      cell_metadata = pDataDT(testobj)
      cortex_cell_ids = cell_metadata[FOV %in% 0:4]$cell_ID
      testobj = subsetGiotto(testobj, cell_ids = cortex_cell_ids)

Since **subsetGiotto** returns a Giotto object, multiple different
objects may be created to store subsets. For the purposes of this
tutorial, only the cortex FOVs will be considered, which is why the
original Giotto Object has been overwritten upon calling
**subsetGiotto**.

2 Filter the Giotto Object
==========================

The Giotto object may be filtered based on:

-  **expression_thresholds** sets a minimum threshold expression level

-  **feat_det_in_min_cells** sets a threshold of the number of cells
   that must include a feature in order to keep that feature in the
   dataset

-  **min_det_feats_per_cell** sets a threshold of the number of features
   expressed by a cell in order to keep that cell in the dataset

The distribution of feature expression can inform stringency of filter
parameters, and can be displayed for both cells and features by calling
**filterDistributions** and specifying the ‘detection’ parameter
accordingly:

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      filterDistributions(testobj, detection = 'cells')

.. image:: /images/images_pkgdown/getting_started_figs/data_processing/0-filterDistributions_cells.png
   :width: 50.0%

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

       filterDistributions(testobj, detection = 'feats')

.. image:: /images/images_pkgdown/getting_started_figs/data_processing/1-filterDistributions_feats.png
   :width: 50.0%

**filterCombinations** may be used to test how different filtering
parameters will affect the number of cells and features in the filtered
data:

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      filterCombinations(testobj,
                         expression_thresholds = c(1,2, 3),
                         feat_det_in_min_cells = c(50, 100, 200),
                         min_det_feats_per_cell = c(5, 10, 25))

.. image:: /images/images_pkgdown/getting_started_figs/data_processing/2-filterCombinations.png
   :width: 50.0%

When a consensus on appropriate filtering parameters has been reached,
provide the arguments to **filterGiotto**.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      testobj <- filterGiotto(gobject = testobj,
                              expression_threshold = 1,
                              feat_det_in_min_cells = 100,
                              min_det_feats_per_cell = 10)

3 Normalize Raw Counts Data
===========================

There are three methods of normalization supported by Giotto.

The ‘standard’ method (default) normalizes the data by total library
size and a custom scale factor, then log transforms and z-scores the
data by cells or genes, specified by scale_order.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      # normalize to scale expression values of the Giotto object using the standard method, z-scoring feats over cells
      testobj <- normalizeGiotto(gobject = testobj, 
                                 norm_methods = 'standard', 
                                 scale_feats = TRUE, 
                                 scalefactor = 6000,
                                 scale_order = 'first_feats', # Default, alternatively 'first_cells'
                                 verbose = T)

The ‘pearson_resid’ method uses the Lause/Kobak et al. method. Fist,
expected values are calculated based on Pearson correlations. Next,
z-scores are calculated based on observed and expected values. *Note
that normalizing with this method will save the data within the “scaled”
expression slot, NOT the “normalized” slot.*

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      # normalize to scale expression values of the Giotto object using the pearson residual method 
      testobj <- normalizeGiotto(gobject = testobj, 
                                 norm_methods = 'pearson_resid', 
                                 scale_feats = TRUE, 
                                 scalefactor = 6000, 
                                 verbose = T)

The ‘osmFISH’ method is intended for in-situ RNA data and uses the
normalization method described by `Codeluppi et
al. <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0175-z.pdf?proof=t>`__
Feature (gene) counts are individually normalized by the total feature
count, and then are multiplied by the total number of features. Then,
cells are individually normalized by dividing the normalized feature
counts by the total feature counts per cell, and then are scaled by the
total number of cells.

Since the data in this tutorial is not in-situ RNA data, this method
will not be shown here. It may be utilized by specifying the
norm_methods argument as ‘osmFISH’.

4 Add Statistics and Metadata to the Giotto Object
==================================================

The function **addStatistics** will add the following statistics to cell
metadata:

-  **nr_feats**: Denotes how many features are detected per cell

-  **perc_feats**: Denotes the percentage of features detected per cell

-  **total_expr**: Shows the total sum of feature expression per cell

It will also add the following statistics to feature metadata:

-  **nr_cells**: Denotes how many cells in which the feature is detected

-  **per_cells**: Denotes the percentage of cells in which the feature
   is detected

-  **total_expr**: Shows the total sum of feature expression in all
   cells

-  **mean_expr**: Average feature expression in all cells

-  **mean_expr_det**: Average feature expression in cells with
   detectable levels of the feature

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      # Add gene & cell statistics to the Giotto object using the data normalized with the standard method
      testobj <- addStatistics(gobject = testobj, expression_values = 'normalized')

      # Accessors:
      cell_metadata_cortex <- pDataDT(testobj)
      feature_metadata_cortex <- fDataDT(testobj)

**addFeatsPerc** can be used to detect the percentage of features in
each cell within a given gene family (ie. mitochondrial genes, ribosomal
genes)

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      #Calculate the percentage of BMP genes per cell
      bmp_genes = grep('Bmp', x = feature_metadata_cortex$feat_ID, value = TRUE)
      testobj <- addFeatsPerc(testobj, 
                              expression_values = 'normalized', 
                              feats = bmp_genes, 
                              vector_name = "perc_bmp")

5 Adjust Expression Matrix
==========================

Adjust expression matrix for known batch effects or technological
covariates

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      # Since there are no known batch effects, the number of features detected per cell
      # will be regressed out so that covariates will not effect further analyses.

      testobj <- adjustGiottoMatrix(gobject = testobj, 
                                    expression_values = c('normalized'),
                                    covariate_columns = 'nr_feats')

6 High Efficiency Data Processing
=================================

**processGiotto** completes the filtering, normalization, statistical,
and adjustment steps of data processing in one single step; this is
ideal for faster processing.

Since adjustment is not necessary for every dataset, *adjust_params* may
be set to NULL to skip this processing step. All other arguments are
user-determined; default arguments will apply to all steps if no
arguments are provided.

.. container:: cell

   .. code:: r

      testobj <- processGiotto(testobj,
                               filter_params = list(expression_threshold = 1,
                                                    feat_det_in_min_cells = 100, 
                                                    min_det_feats_per_cell = 10),
                               norm_params = list(norm_methods = 'standard', 
                                                  scale_feats = TRUE, 
                                                  scalefactor = 6000),
                               stat_params = list(expression_values = 'normalized'),
                               adjust_params = list(expression_values = c('normalized'), 
                                                    covariate_columns = 'nr_feats'))
