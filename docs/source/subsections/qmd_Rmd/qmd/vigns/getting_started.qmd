Giotto provides a lot of analyses, visualizations and other options to facilitate your spatial dataset analysis.
We are working on providing easy-to-understand examples or tutorials, but if anything is not clear or if there is something you would like to see in particular, then do not hesitate to contact [us](https://github.com/drieslab/Giotto/issues).

\  

## Installation

You can install Giotto Suite on any platform in 2 easy steps:

#### Step 1: install Giotto Suite
``` r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("drieslab/Giotto@suite") 
```

#### Step 2: install the Giotto python environment
The python environment only needs to be installed once.

``` r
library(Giotto)
installGiottoEnvironment()
```

This command only needs to be run once and then Giotto will automatically detect the environment in the future.  

For more information:   

* See [Installation](https://giottosuite.com/articles/temp_construction.html) for alternative (manual) installation options.  
* See [Giotto Environment](https://giottosuite.com/articles/temp_construction.html) to learn more about the Giotto environment.  
* See [FAQ](https://giottosuite.com/articles/faq.html) for troubleshooting.
